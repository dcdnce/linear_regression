# linear_regression

#todo
- Two program
	- Predict (class and file)
		- Ask for mileage
		- Take theta values from file
	- Model
		- Option to stop after n iterations when MSE (or coeffs?) is already optimal
- Auto initialization with pip requirement and all

Bonus
- Various direct plot visualization
	- Current MSE 
		- current error
- Precision of model
