# linear_regression

#todo
- Add learning rate
- Two program
	- Predict (class and file)
		- Ask for mileage
		- Take theta values from file
	- Model
		- Input (iterations, learning_rate)
		- Option to stop after n iterations when MSE (or coeffs?) is already optimal

Bonus
- Various direct plot visualization
	- Current prediction line (with t0, t1, iteration nb)
	- Current MSE (in 3D?!(t0, t1, error))
- Precision of model
